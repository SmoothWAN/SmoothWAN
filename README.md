**Project sunset after 3 years for the following reasons**
- [Speedify officially supports OpenWrt as of Q4 2024](https://support.speedify.com/article/918-openwrt)
- GL.iNet auto build repos went private, certain patches for [wlan-ap](https://github.com/gl-inet/wlan-ap) are missing.
- Wi-Fi 6+ is unstable with OpenWrt official firmware for GL.iNet and most routers.
- Speedify now requires a [seperate subscription for routers](https://speedify.com/store/#routers) and the pricing is very steep for me.

The firmware should work for a good while and the Speedify installer has a URL entry that can be updated.

<h2>DIY Internet bonding router with seamless failover using Speedify</h2> 

<i>SmoothWAN</i> is a custom [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) router distribution for fixed internet bonding setup using Speedify, with an emphasis on using an internet browser for easy configuration on the go. <br>  
This project is not affiliated with Speedify or Connectify.<br>

As of Q4 2024, Speedify now requires a [license for routers](https://speedify.com/store/#routers).

Also includes <a href="https://github.com/porech/engarde">Engarde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wangyu-/tinyfecVPN">TinyFEC VPN</a> as alternative and self-hosting solutions.<br>


Visit the [wiki](https://smoothwan.com) for information and guides.    

*Supported hardware*
(order by performance)

- PC Intel/AMD
- Raspberry Pi 4 / Pi 400
- GL.iNet Flint
- GL.iNet Slate AX

Only supporting devices that are difficult to brick/damage with 3rd party firmware. (read-only bootloader from webpage upgrade)

~For running on other hardware or existing OpenWrt users you can use the unofficial installer [here](https://github.com/TalalMash/Unofficial-Speedify-Installer-For-OpenWrt)~

*Use cases*

- Run a VPN over Speedify to bypass captcha/IP-blocking on public servers or other uses.
- Cover all connected devices in a home network when it's not possible or practical to share a WAN per each device running Speedify such as IoT and security systems.  
- Use [Engarde](https://github.com/porech/engarde) as self-hosting alternative to Speedify's Redundant mode (lossless by duplicating traffic across WANs - no aggregation)
- Use [TinyFEC VPN](https://github.com/wangyu-/tinyfecVPN) for fixing a lossy unusable internet connection using forward-error-correction at a speed cost (single WAN - self-hosting)
